<h1>Undergraduate lecture notes</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This repository contains all the lecture notes I made during my BSc in Mathematics at the University of St Andrews. The notes are written in markdown and the equations/symbols are written in LaTeX. It is recommended to use Obsidian to get all the hyperlinks, themes and graphs working.
